Real-time YOLOv4-Tiny object detection with distance estimation, voice alerts, and a Tkinter control panel.

**StreetVision** is a Python-based computer vision tool that uses **YOLOv4-Tiny** to detect objects in real-time from your camera, estimate their distance, and announce them with voice alerts.  
It features a simple **Tkinter GUI** to switch between detection modes, adjust confidence, and toggle voice output.

## ðŸ“¥ Setup

Download YOLOv4-Tiny weights
The YOLOv4-Tiny config file (yolov4-tiny.cfg) is already included in this repository.
However, the weights file is not included because it is large.

Official download link:
ðŸ“¥ [Download yolov4-tiny.weights (from AlexeyAB/darknet)](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights)

After downloading:
Place the file yolov4-tiny.weights in the same folder as StreetVision.py.

Run the application:
python detector_gui.py
